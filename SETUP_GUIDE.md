## Prerequisites

### Snowflake Account Requirements

- **Account Type**: Enterprise or Business Critical edition (for Cortex AI access)
- **Region**: Ensure Cortex AI is available in your region
- **Access**: Snowsight UI
- **Privileges Required**: A role with the following grants:
  - `CREATE DATABASE`
  - `CREATE SCHEMA`
  - `CREATE TABLE`
  - `CREATE STAGE`
  - `CREATE STREAMLIT`
  - `CREATE FUNCTION` (for UDFs)
  - `USAGE` on CORTEX AI models

### Privilege Verification

Run these queries in Snowsight to verify your role has the necessary privileges:

```sql
-- Check database creation privilege
SHOW GRANTS TO ROLE <YOUR_ROLE>;

-- Check Cortex AI availability
SHOW CORTEX FUNCTIONS;
```

**Expected results**:
- `CREATE DATABASE` privilege should be visible for your role
- `SHOW CORTEX FUNCTIONS;` should list models like `claude-3-5-sonnet`, `gpt-4o`, `pixtral-large`

---

## Step-by-Step Deployment

![Deployment Phases](images/deployment_phases.svg)

### Phase 1: Database Setup (~5 minutes)

#### 1.1 Connect to Snowflake
- Log in to your Snowflake account via Snowsight
- Navigate to **Worksheets** in the left sidebar
- Create a new SQL worksheet

#### 1.2 Run Database Setup Script
1. Open the `setup.sql` file from this repository
2. Copy the entire contents
3. Paste into your Snowflake SQL worksheet
4. Execute the script by clicking **Run All** or pressing `Ctrl+Enter`

**What `setup.sql` creates:**
- Database: `PDF_ANALYTICS_DB`
- Schema: `PDF_PROCESSING`
- Tables: `PDF_TEXT_DATA`, `IMAGE_ANALYSIS_RESULTS`, `APP_CONFIG`
- Stages: `PDF_IMAGES_STAGE`, `PDF_FILES_STAGE`
- UDFs: `EXTRACT_PDF_TEXT()`, `GET_PDF_IMAGE_COUNT()` (uses PyPDF2 package)

#### 1.3 Verification

```sql
USE DATABASE PDF_ANALYTICS_DB;
USE SCHEMA PDF_PROCESSING;

-- Check tables
SHOW TABLES;
-- Expected: PDF_TEXT_DATA, IMAGE_ANALYSIS_RESULTS, APP_CONFIG

-- Check stages
SHOW STAGES;
-- Expected: PDF_IMAGES_STAGE, PDF_FILES_STAGE

-- CRITICAL: Verify UDFs exist
SHOW FUNCTIONS;
-- Expected: EXTRACT_PDF_TEXT(VARCHAR), GET_PDF_IMAGE_COUNT(VARCHAR)
```

---

### Phase 2: Warehouse Setup (~2 minutes)

Create a dedicated warehouse for your Streamlit application:

```sql
CREATE WAREHOUSE IF NOT EXISTS STREAMLIT_WH
    WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'MEDIUM'
    AUTO_SUSPEND = 60  -- Suspends after 1 minute of inactivity
    AUTO_RESUME = TRUE
    INITIALLY_SUSPENDED = TRUE
    COMMENT = 'Warehouse for Streamlit PDF processing app';
    
-- Grant usage to your role (if not ACCOUNTADMIN)
GRANT USAGE ON WAREHOUSE STREAMLIT_WH TO ROLE <YOUR_ROLE>;
```

**Warehouse Size Recommendations:**

![Warehouse Sizing](images/warehouse_sizing.svg)

---

### Phase 3: Streamlit App Creation (~5 minutes)

#### 3.1 Create the App
1. In Snowsight, navigate to **Streamlit** in the left sidebar
2. Click the **+ Streamlit App** button
3. Configure the new app:
   - **App name**: `PDF_Processing_App` (or your preferred name)
   - **App location**:
     - Database: `PDF_ANALYTICS_DB`
     - Schema: `PDF_PROCESSING`
   - **App warehouse**: Select `STREAMLIT_WH`
4. Click **Create** - this opens the Streamlit app editor

#### 3.2 Deploy Application Code
1. In the editor, you'll see a default template
2. **Delete all the default code** in the editor
3. Copy the entire contents of `streamlit_app.py` from this repository
4. Paste it into the editor
5. Click **Run** in the top-right corner
6. **Verify**: The app should load without syntax errors and display the UI

---

### Phase 4: Dependencies Installation (~2 minutes)

Streamlit in Snowflake includes most common packages by default. You need to add `PyMuPDF` and `Pillow`.

**Method A: Using Packages Tab (Recommended)**
1. In the Streamlit app editor, go to the **Packages** tab
2. Add the following packages:
   - `pypdf2` (version: latest or `~3.0.0`)
   - `pillow` (version: latest or `~10.0.0`)
3. Save changes. The app will automatically restart with the new packages.

**Method B: Using `environment.yml` File**
1. Ensure your local `environment.yml` file contains:
   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     - streamlit=1.26.0
     - pypdf2
     - pillow
   ```
2. In the Streamlit app editor, go to the **Settings** tab
3. Upload your `environment.yml` file
4. Save changes. The app will restart and install dependencies

---

### Phase 5: Configure Permissions (if not ACCOUNTADMIN) (~1 minute)

If you're not using the `ACCOUNTADMIN` role, grant necessary permissions to your custom role:

```sql
USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN; -- Switch to ACCOUNTADMIN for grants

-- Replace <YOUR_ROLE> with your actual role name
GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE PDF_ANALYTICS_DB TO ROLE <YOUR_ROLE>;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA PDF_ANALYTICS_DB.PDF_PROCESSING TO ROLE <YOUR_ROLE>;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA PDF_ANALYTICS_DB.PDF_PROCESSING TO ROLE <YOUR_ROLE>;
GRANT READ, WRITE ON ALL STAGES IN SCHEMA PDF_ANALYTICS_DB.PDF_PROCESSING TO ROLE <YOUR_ROLE>;
GRANT USAGE ON ALL FUNCTIONS IN SCHEMA PDF_ANALYTICS_DB.PDF_PROCESSING TO ROLE <YOUR_ROLE>;
GRANT USAGE ON WAREHOUSE STREAMLIT_WH TO ROLE <YOUR_ROLE>;

-- For Cortex AI usage
GRANT USAGE ON FUTURE CORTEX MODELS TO ROLE <YOUR_ROLE>;

USE ROLE <YOUR_ROLE>; -- Switch back to your role
```

---

## Configuration & Customization

### Application Configuration

Edit these variables in `streamlit_app.py` if you used different names during setup:

```python
# Lines 34-39: Database and Schema Configuration
DATABASE = "PDF_ANALYTICS_DB"
SCHEMA = "PDF_PROCESSING"
TEXT_TABLE = "PDF_TEXT_DATA"
ANALYSIS_TABLE = "IMAGE_ANALYSIS_RESULTS"
IMAGE_STAGE = "PDF_IMAGES_STAGE"
PDF_STAGE = "PDF_FILES_STAGE"

# Lines 42-46: Available Cortex AI Models
AVAILABLE_MODELS = {
    "Claude (Anthropic)": "claude-3-5-sonnet",
    "GPT-4o (OpenAI)": "gpt-4o",
    "Pixtral Large (Mistral)": "pixtral-large"
}

# Lines 56-101: Default Analysis Categories
# Customize DEFAULT_CATEGORIES to define what the AI should detect
```

### Warehouse Configuration

Adjust warehouse size based on usage:

```sql
-- Change warehouse size
ALTER WAREHOUSE STREAMLIT_WH 
SET WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'SMALL' | 'MEDIUM' | 'LARGE';

-- Adjust auto-suspend (in seconds)
ALTER WAREHOUSE STREAMLIT_WH 
SET AUTO_SUSPEND = 60; -- 1 minute recommended
```

### Custom Analysis Categories

The application supports custom analysis categories beyond the defaults. Add categories through the UI:

1. Navigate to sidebar â†’ "Analysis Categories"
2. Click "âž• Add Custom Category"
3. Enter category name and description
4. Categories are saved to `APP_CONFIG` table

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

![Troubleshooting](images/troubleshooting.svg)

**Quick Reference Table:**

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `Unsupported component error: st.file_uploader` | Outdated Streamlit version | Ensure `streamlit=1.26.0` in environment.yml or Packages tab |
| `Anaconda dependency names must be lowercase...` | Invalid dependency syntax | Correct `streamlit>=1.26.0` to `streamlit=1.26.0` |
| `Module not found: PyMuPDF / Pillow` | Missing packages | Add `pypdf2` and `pillow` in Packages tab |
| `Unknown user-defined function EXTRACT_PDF_TEXT` | UDFs not created | Re-run `setup.sql` and verify with `SHOW FUNCTIONS;` |
| `Permission denied on stage` | Insufficient permissions | Grant READ, WRITE permissions (see Phase 5) |
| `Cortex model not available` | Cortex AI not enabled | Verify with `SHOW CORTEX FUNCTIONS;`, contact Snowflake support |
| `Table not found` | Setup script not run | Ensure `setup.sql` ran successfully |
| App runs slowly | Insufficient warehouse | Increase warehouse size to MEDIUM or LARGE |
| Buttons don't work | Various issues | Check warehouse is running, verify UDFs exist |
| Text extraction returns "Error" | Invalid PDF or UDF issues | Verify PDF validity, check stage with `LIST @PDF_FILES_STAGE;` |
| Images not displaying | Upload failed | Check images uploaded: `LIST @PDF_IMAGES_STAGE;` |

### Detailed Troubleshooting Steps

#### Error: "Function EXTRACT_PDF_TEXT does not exist"

**Cause**: UDFs weren't created in Snowflake  
**Solution**: 
1. Re-run `setup.sql` in a Snowflake worksheet
2. Verify with `SHOW FUNCTIONS;`
3. Ensure you see both `EXTRACT_PDF_TEXT` and `GET_PDF_IMAGE_COUNT`

#### Error: "Permission denied on stage"

**Solution**:
```sql
USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;
GRANT READ, WRITE ON STAGE PDF_ANALYTICS_DB.PDF_PROCESSING.PDF_FILES_STAGE TO ROLE <YOUR_ROLE>;
GRANT READ, WRITE ON STAGE PDF_ANALYTICS_DB.PDF_PROCESSING.PDF_IMAGES_STAGE TO ROLE <YOUR_ROLE>;
```

#### Error: "Cortex model not available"

**Check Cortex availability**:
```sql
SHOW CORTEX FUNCTIONS;
```
If empty, Cortex AI may not be enabled in your account/region. Contact your Snowflake account team.

#### App Loads But Buttons Don't Work

**Check**:
1. Warehouse is running: `SHOW WAREHOUSES LIKE 'STREAMLIT_WH';`
2. Database context is correct: `SELECT CURRENT_DATABASE(), CURRENT_SCHEMA();`
3. UDFs exist: `SHOW FUNCTIONS;`
4. Review Streamlit logs in app interface for errors

#### Text Extraction Returns "Error"

**Check**:
1. PDF is valid and not corrupted
2. PDF uploaded to stage: `LIST @PDF_FILES_STAGE;`
3. File path is correct
4. UDF has proper permissions

### General Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Review Streamlit App Logs**: Access logs within the Streamlit app interface for detailed error messages
2. **Check Snowflake Query History**: Examine query history in Snowsight for failed SQL commands
3. **Verify Object Existence**: Use `SHOW TABLES;`, `SHOW STAGES;`, `SHOW FUNCTIONS;` to confirm all objects exist
4. **Confirm Permissions**: Double-check all required grants are in place
5. **Warehouse Status**: Ensure warehouse is running and not suspended

## Architecture & Implementation

### System Architecture

![System Architecture](images/architecture_detailed.svg)

### Data Flow

1. **Upload**: User uploads PDF via Streamlit UI. Streamlit saves to `PDF_FILES_STAGE`
2. **Text Extraction**: Streamlit calls UDF `EXTRACT_PDF_TEXT()` with staged PDF URL. UDF extracts text, returns to Streamlit, which saves to `PDF_TEXT_DATA` table
3. **Image Extraction**: Streamlit calls UDF `GET_PDF_IMAGE_COUNT()` to count images. Streamlit extracts images and saves to `PDF_IMAGES_STAGE`
4. **Analysis**: Images are passed to Cortex AI models. Results (JSON) are parsed and saved to `IMAGE_ANALYSIS_RESULTS` table
5. **Visualization**: Results displayed in Streamlit UI with thumbnails loaded via presigned URLs

### Key Implementation Details

- **PDF Processing**: All PDF parsing (PyPDF2) occurs within Snowflake Python UDFs
- **Package Availability**: Streamlit in Snowflake pre-installs common packages. PyPDF2 is specified in UDF `PACKAGES` clause
- **Cortex AI**: Integrates via `SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.COMPLETE` function calls from Snowpark
- **Batch Processing**: Uses `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` for parallel image analysis
- **Security**: SQL injection protection via Snowpark DataFrame API

## Security & Access Control

### Role-Based Access

Create a dedicated role for app users:

```sql
-- Create dedicated role
CREATE ROLE PDF_PROCESSOR_ROLE;

-- Grant necessary privileges
GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE PDF_ANALYTICS_DB TO ROLE PDF_PROCESSOR_ROLE;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA PDF_ANALYTICS_DB.PDF_PROCESSING TO ROLE PDF_PROCESSOR_ROLE;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA PDF_ANALYTICS_DB.PDF_PROCESSING TO ROLE PDF_PROCESSOR_ROLE;
GRANT READ, WRITE ON ALL STAGES IN SCHEMA PDF_ANALYTICS_DB.PDF_PROCESSING TO ROLE PDF_PROCESSOR_ROLE;
GRANT USAGE ON ALL FUNCTIONS IN SCHEMA PDF_ANALYTICS_DB.PDF_PROCESSING TO ROLE PDF_PROCESSOR_ROLE;
GRANT USAGE ON WAREHOUSE STREAMLIT_WH TO ROLE PDF_PROCESSOR_ROLE;

-- Grant role to users
GRANT ROLE PDF_PROCESSOR_ROLE TO USER <USERNAME>;
```

### Data Retention

```sql
-- Set retention policy on tables
ALTER TABLE PDF_TEXT_DATA SET DATA_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS = 7;
ALTER TABLE IMAGE_ANALYSIS_RESULTS SET DATA_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS = 7;
```

### Grant App Access

```sql
-- Grant Streamlit app access to team role
GRANT USAGE ON STREAMLIT PDF_ANALYTICS_DB.PDF_PROCESSING.PDF_PROCESSING_APP TO ROLE <TEAM_ROLE>;
```

## Performance Optimization

### Processing Times (Typical)

![Processing Times](images/processing_times.svg)

### Warehouse Sizing

![Warehouse Sizing Decision](images/warehouse_sizing.svg)

### Batch Processing

![Batch Processing](images/batch_processing.svg)

Adjust batch size for optimal performance:
- **Batch size 1-3**: Sequential processing, good for small workloads
- **Batch size 5**: Balanced parallel processing (default, recommended)
- **Batch size 8-10**: Maximum parallelism, best for large image sets

### Monitoring

```sql
-- Check warehouse usage
SELECT * FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY
WHERE WAREHOUSE_NAME = 'STREAMLIT_WH'
ORDER BY START_TIME DESC;

-- Check table sizes
SELECT 
    TABLE_NAME,
    ROW_COUNT,
    BYTES / (1024*1024) AS SIZE_MB
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES
WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'PDF_PROCESSING';
```
